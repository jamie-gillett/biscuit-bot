# biscuit bot
Auto-clicker bot made for [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

When it's running press '\[' to toggle the auto-clicker on and off or '\]' to terminate the program.

## Purpose
Just a fun little bot to make an idle game more idle.

## Features
Currently the bot will:
- Continuously click on the main cookie
- Click on upgrades when they are available
- Click on some buildings when they are available (from Cursor to Shipment)

## Future Directions
Possible future directions:
- Optimize Upgrader and Builder components
- Revert Upgrader to be generic (requires optimization first)
- Restructure classes
- Get the Golden Cookie component working consistently
